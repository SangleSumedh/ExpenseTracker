# ExpenseTracker

## Merge 1
Added HTML, CSS and Script file to repository 
so far, the localstorage api is used to store expenses.
if the browser isn't close the expenses do not go away (Opera browsers store data even after closing so it permanently stores it)
but if chrome is closed it will remove data from localstorage 
backend is not yet created



A Full-Stack Application for a Expense Tracker.
